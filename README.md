# Keeping Time
This is the code for my Chrome extension, Keeping Time.
Keeping Time aims to increase users' productivity by encouraging them to set goals on different time scales, blocking websites, and setting timers to limit the use of certain websites. <br>
Features of this extension include: <br>
AI-generated inspirational quotes. <br>

A page for intercepting requests for blocked cite urls. This page can unblock your websites, but only after you set a daily, weekly, and long-term goal, and set a timer. <br>
