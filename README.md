Chrome extension code
This is the code for my Chrome extension, Keeping Time.
This is meant to increase users' productivity by encouraging them to set goals on different time scales, blocking websites, and setting timers to limit the use of certain websites
Features of this extension include:
AI-generated inspirational quotes.
A todo-list page in the window of any newly made tab.
A timer in the popup page that appears when the extension icon is clicked.
A page for specifying websites to block.
A page for intercepting requests for blocked cite urls. This page can unblock your websites, but only after you set a daily, weekly, and long-term goal, and set a timer.
